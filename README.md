# Overview
- **ExampleDataPipeline.m** and **MinimalExampleHPC.m** together provide an example of how to run our analysis pipeline for orientation preference maps. The workflow is split into two parts: the first part is designed for a personal computer to set all necessary parameters, while the second part runs on a high-performance computing (HPC) system, using the parameters defined in the first part.
- The folder **OPM_Processing** contains all MATLAB functions for various scientific analyses and data handling.
- **ExampleDataPipeline.m** demonstrates how to perform the basic analysis steps for processing an orientation preference map in angle format.
