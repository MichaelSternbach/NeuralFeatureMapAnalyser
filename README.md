# Overview

**ExampleDataPipeline.m** and **MinimalExampleHPC.m** provide a complete example of how to run our analysis pipeline for orientation preference maps. The workflow is divided into two parts:

1. The first part is designed for a personal computer and sets all necessary parameters.
    
2. The second part runs on a high-performance computing (HPC) system, using the parameters defined in the first part.
    

The folder **OPM_Processing** contains all MATLAB functions for scientific analyses and data handling.

**ExampleDataPipeline.m** demonstrates the basic steps for processing an orientation preference map in angle format.

# Additional Information

Detailed information about the code and its scientific background is provided in the manuscript _A Transparent Analysis Pipeline for the Quantification of Confidence of Neural Feature Maps_, which can be found in the doctoral thesis of Michael Sternbach (_Structure and Evolution of Visual Cortical Representations_):
